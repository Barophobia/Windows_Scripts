# Windows Scripts

## How to run
All scripts should be run as admin, there is currently no particular order.

## What this doesn't do
- This doesn't disable Onedrive, to disable Onedrive completely use the Remove_OneDrive.ps1 script and disable the OneDrive GPO.

## Disclaimer 
These are used at your own risk :)
